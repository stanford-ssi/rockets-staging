# SSI Rockets Olympus Staging
_______________________________
SSI Rockets Staging R&amp;D Project

## Overview
The goals of the staging project is to produce a device that can reliably and abruptly separate two sections of a rocket airframe during flight. The device has to hold to the sections together during ascent and then separate them on command (a wireless signal from the main avionics bay). The result is an integrated electromechanical device that can communicate over WiFi or wired signals to any WiFi-enabled device.
