This is a list of things that we have to do with the code / pcb before the launch, in this order.

Check pcb for shorts
Assemble pcb
Solder on larger components
Double check that everything is connected properly
Turn on power supplies and see if we actually get 3.3V and 24V
Flash Arduino onto the Samd21
Flash code onto the esp -> use the code that can be re-written wirelessly!

===========================
TEST 1: SAMD21 Talks
===========================
Blink sketch
Write to SD card
Drives motor?

===========================
TEST 2: ESP Talks
===========================
OTA Blink Sketch (FlightCodeRevA)
Wireless 'arming' blink sketch
ESP tells SAMD21 to blink
ESP tells SAMD21 to rotate motor
Wirelessly activate ESP to tell SAMD21 to rotate motor

===========================
TEST 3: Put it together
===========================
All at the same time:
	- SAMD21 running motor if told
	- Records data to SD card the whole time, including from photoresistor
	- SAMD21 receives commands from ESP and can send things back
	-
